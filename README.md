== README

Blocitoff manages your tasks allowing you to use a rake task to delete to-do items that have not been completed after seven days. The assumption is that if the to-do item is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.  

I am receiving generous help from my mentor Dalibor Ilijevski.

I did this project in order to learn how to build rails apps, so although it functions, it's not pretty. Even the functionality is limited.  I could have added more, but I wanted to focus my attention on the requirements which would help me to master specific aspects of Rails web development.  As in any craft, a solid foundation sets you up well to do complicated things.
